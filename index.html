        <p>Bengali cuisine is the culinary style of Bengal, that comprises Bangladesh and the Indian states of West Bengal, Tripura and Assam's Karimganj district.[1] The cuisine has been shaped by the region's diverse history and climate. It is known for its varied use of flavours including mustard oil, as well as the spread of its confectioneries and desserts.[2] There is a strong emphasis on rice as a staple,[3] with fish traditionally the most common protein. Freshwater fish are preferred to seafish, although barramundi, known as bhetki, is also common.[4] Meat is also a common protein among Bengalis with chicken, mutton and pork meat being the most popular. Beef is popular within the muslim community. In more recent times, lentils have begun to form a significant part of the diet.[5] Many Bengali food traditions draw from social activities, such as adda, Poila Boishakh and Durga Puja.</p>
